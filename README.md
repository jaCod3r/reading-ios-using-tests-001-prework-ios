For the time being, please refer to Mark's blog post about Specta/Expecta. Skip the beginning about setting up Xcode for writing tests, just focus on the anatomy of a Spec file:

# Using Tests

Moving forward, all of our labs are going to include a test suite to ensure that your successfully completed the lab! If you expand the Tests folder in your lab, you will see a file (or two or three!) that usually ends in the word `Spec.m`. This is where the tests are located. If you follow the README instructions you shouldn't have to look to much at the tests, but you will need to run them! To run the tests hit `cmd-u`. To view the test results click on icon 4 from the left in the left bar. This should have either all green checkmarks or maybe some red x's. The red x means you failed a test. To view exactly what failed, go ahead and hit the icon 3 from the left and you should be able to see what exactly went wrong.

If you feel like you did everything correctly, and the tests are wrong then post on Piazza or ask in Slack!
